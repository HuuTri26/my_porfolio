# Basic Git Guide

**Git** is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It helps multiple developers collaborate by managing code history, avoiding conflicts, and allowing easy rollback.

## Key Concepts in Git

- **Repository (repo):** The project folder containing all history.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of changes made to the files.
- **Branch:** An independent line of development.
- **Merge:** Combining different branches.

## Common Basic Git Commands

git init # Initialize a new Git repository
git add . # Stage changes for commit
git commit -m "message" # Commit changes with a descriptive message
git branch # List branches
git checkout <branch> # Switch branches
git merge <branch> # Merge another branch into current one

## Why Use Git?

- Tracks every modification to the project.
- Supports branching and merging for parallel development.
- Facilitates team collaboration.
- Allows easy recovery of previous versions.

## Summary

Git is an indispensable tool for developers to manage code versions and collaborate effectively on projects of any size.
